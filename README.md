# AlexNet
AlexNet
AlexNet is a groundbreaking convolutional neural network (CNN) that achieved remarkable success in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012. Its architecture and training techniques significantly advanced the field of computer vision and deep learning.

Key Architectural Features:

Eight Layers: The network consists of five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers.
ReLU Activation: Instead of the traditional sigmoid or tanh activation functions, AlexNet utilized the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which accelerates training and mitigates the vanishing gradient problem.
Multiple GPUs: The model was designed to be trained across two NVIDIA GTX 580 GPUs, enabling the training of a larger and more complex network.
Local Response Normalization (LRN): This layer helps in lateral inhibition, promoting competition among neurons and enhancing the network's generalization ability.
Overlapping Pooling: Unlike traditional non-overlapping pooling, AlexNet used overlapping pooling, which reduced overfitting and improved accuracy.
Dropout: To further combat overfitting, dropout layers were applied to the fully connected layers during training. This technique randomly deactivates neurons, forcing the network to learn more robust features.
Impact and Significance:

AlexNet's victory in ILSVRC 2012 demonstrated the power of deep learning for image recognition tasks. Its innovative architectural choices and training methodologies inspired a surge of research and development in CNNs, paving the way for many of the advanced architectures we see today. It marked a turning point in the field, ushering in the modern era of deep learning in computer vision.
